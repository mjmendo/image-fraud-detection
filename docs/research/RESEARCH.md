## Research prompt

```markdown
Make a research of the state of the art image tampering detection for the insurance industry, specifically for car damage claims. Focus on Europe and particularly in Germany. Size the market and the solution costs. Separate the COTS from what is recommended to be in-house. Analyze the role of ML/AI in this space.

Details:
1. The research task does not include video tampering. ONLY images.
2. The research task does not include documents or any other type of fraud detection than damage-related image fraud detection.
2. Include automated AI/ML and standard code systems/solutions. Only mention manual fraud detection when relevant.
3. Market size and costs should be broken down in Germany vs Europe.
4. The research is not about insurance companies, it is about the technology used in the insurance industry for image fraud detection.
5. The research is only about post-incident detection technologies. Nothing about pre-damage should be included.
6. Structure the output with bullets and diagrams when relevant.
7. Do not include academic research. Only in-house solutions and COTS for reference with tradeoffs.
8. Technical detail: focus on use cases, tradeoffs.
